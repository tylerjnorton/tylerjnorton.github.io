                <h1>Taskmetro</h1>
                <p>Taskmetro is a city exploration game that turns any city with public transportation into a game board. Teams race to explore the most places, complete the most tasks, and earn the most points. Players use metro stops, subway stations, and bus routes to navigate, drawing task cards and proving completion through photos and messages. It's an active, outdoor experience where first playtests averaged over 25,000 steps.</p>
                <p>I designed and developed Taskmetro over 200 hours, inspired by shows like Jetlag: The Game and Taskmaster, combined with my love of travel, board games, and escape rooms. The goal was to create something accessible and playable anywhere in the world. The game successfully reached its Kickstarter goal with 167 backers and $10,328 in support.</p>
                <p>I handled the entire creation process myself, from design through Kickstarter campaign materials and fulfillment. The initial run was limited to around 1,000 copies as a one-person operation. If you're interested in getting a copy, additional orders are available at <a href="https://taskmetro.square.site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Taskmetro Store</a>.</p>

                <h1>Brands</h1>
                <p>I've shaped brand identities as a Creative Design Lead at multiple companies, building visual systems that balance creative vision with practical business needs. That experience taught me how to work across departments, scale systems across different touchpoints, and create frameworks that connect strategy to visual execution.</p>
                <p>I also work with freelance clients on brand projects, including restaurants, personal brands, and B2B/B2C companies. Each project is different, requiring me to think strategically about what makes a brand unique and how to translate that into something that feels authentic and works across different channels.</p>
                <p>Whether it's establishing new identities, refreshing existing ones, or creating animated systems, I focus on understanding each client's story and positioning, then building visual languages that feel right and function effectively.</p>

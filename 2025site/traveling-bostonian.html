                <h1>Traveling Bostonian</h1>
                <p>Traveling Bostonian is a personal brand and website I built entirely from scratch. I created the brand identity, designed the site, coded it, and filled it with content that's 100% my own: stories I've written, photographs I've taken, and experiences I've lived while traveling through Europe and beyond.</p>
                <p>This project represents years spent documenting my travels, exploring new cities, and capturing moments that matter. Every design decision, every line of code, and every photograph reflects my perspective and style. It's a portfolio of both my travel experiences and my abilities as a designer, developer, and storyteller.</p>
                <p>You can explore the full site at <a href="https://travelingbostonian.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travelingbostonian.com</a>.</p>

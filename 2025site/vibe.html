                <h1>Vibes and AI Projects</h1>
                <p>I can build entire websites and web applications in a single day using modern tools like Bolt.new. This rapid prototyping approach lets me move quickly from idea to functional product, turning concepts into working tools people can actually use.</p>
                <p>One example is <a href="https://game-film.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">game-film.com</a>, a free tool designed to help teams analyze sports film and improve through telestration. You can upload any YouTube video and annotate directly over gameplay, marking up plays, defensive assignments, and tactical breakdowns in real time. It's built for coaches and players who want a simple way to study film together.</p>
                <p>Another is <a href="https://ux-resource.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ux-resource.com</a>, a curated directory of tools, guides, and resources for UX designers across all disciplines. It's designed to be a reference point for designers looking to find the right tools for their work, whether they're doing research, design, prototyping, or user testing.</p>
                <p>These projects show what's possible when you combine speed, focus, and the right tech stack. Quick builds don't mean low quality, they just mean solving real problems without unnecessary complexity.</p>

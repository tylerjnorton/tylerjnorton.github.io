                    <p><b>Objective</b> ― Make a simple, intuitive substitute for physical cards to display at point of sale.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>My Role</b> ― UX and UI Design. I worked in tandem with my developer friend <a href="https://acoll.github.io/">Adam</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Prompt ―</h3>
                    <p>Assembly Row wanted to change from handing out a plastic card to a digital solution. The card was used for resident and employee discounts for the
                         at the restaurants and shops in Assembly Row. They wanted to take the card out of the wallet and put
                        it on the phone. They also needed a more intelligent way to track where the card is
                        being used and how often. It was also a requirement to fit in with the current branding of Assembly Row, while still
                        putting a twist on the mystic perks program.

                    <h3>User Stories ―</h3>
                    <p>For the most part there was really one user flow that would capture 99.9% of the traffic to the app. Residents or employees would
                        be given a piece of marketing material telling them to save the web app to their home screen, then they would provide an email
                        address once along with information about where they work or live to verify that they were employees or residents. After that
                        they would forever have access to the list of deals to use. The admins at Assembly Row were not concerned about security, and
                        even encouraged the sharing of this to collect more emails to market to as well as attract more business to them instead of the surrounding
                        neighborhoods.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once users accessed the list, they can select the deal from the vendor they are at and show the following "card screen" to get
                        the discount. Vendors were also able to input unique content onto this page like a QR code for point of sale scanning.

                    <h3>Admin & Analytics ―</h3>
                    <p>Admin users had access to a secure backend where they can add new perks, manage users, POS interactivity, resident/employee options, exports
                        of user email data, and more. There was also a custom analytics dashboard showing how often users viewed each deals and 
                        which deals were trending over days, weeks, and months of time. It also shows which users are the highest users of the Mystic
                        Perks app.

                    <h3>Results ―</h3>
                    <p>The users have given very positive feedback on the new app experience and once out initial training was complete we were able to hand off the app to Assembly Row and allow them to
                        use it without continued support from us. We have handled a few admin feature requests from time to time,
                        but overall it was a great project with a great outcome.

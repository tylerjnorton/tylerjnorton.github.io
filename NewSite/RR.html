							<h3 class="title font-recoleta">About RocketReach</h3>
							<p>RocketReach needed a design leader to implement design system and processes, assess design team headcount & needs, hire an internal design team, provide UX strategy to product, elevate design within the org.							</p>
							<p>Initially I took a deep dive into RocketReach’s current design process and designers upon realizing that their initial process was flawed. We quickly realized that they needed UX designers, a design system, and strategic thinkers, as their one graphic designer was more suited to focus on marketing.							</p>
							<div class="border-block">
								<h6 class="sub-heading">Project Process</h6>
								<h3 class="title font-recoleta">Hiring & Building Design Culture.								</h3>
								<p>After an agreement was reached on the process to be implemented and the velocity that development teams could handle, bandwidth became the next issue to address. Within three weeks, job descriptions were written, the positions were posted, portfolios were reviewed, interviews were conducted, and multiple positions were filled (Jr UX and Sr UX). After ramping up the new hires, we transitioned the current designer to a marketing role, where he was able to make the most of his skills and improve the visual brand quality of our marketing content.
								</p>
								<p>To retain newly hired UX designers, we implemented several initiatives. The team set up pair designing mentor sessions, where new hires could learn from and collaborate with more experienced designers. They also provided space for learning and development. Additionally, we began holding blue sky creative sessions, where designers could experiment with new ideas and take risks. These initiatives helped to create a positive and supportive work environment where UX designers felt valued and encouraged to grow.

								<h3 class="title font-recoleta">Creative Strategy & Design Maturity
								</h3>
								<p>In addition to working with the design team, we also partnered with RocketReach's founders, head of product, and C-suite level partners to help organize product priorities, personas, user journey maps, and product priority roadmaps. This was done in order to ensure that the new design process was aligned with the overall business goals of the company. The result was a set of clear and concise roadmaps that helped to guide the design team in their work and ensured that the final product met the needs of both users and stakeholders.
								</p>
								<p>After the initial onboarding and ramping up of new hires, RocketReach implemented bi-weekly demos where designers presented their recent work. These demos provided an opportunity for designers to receive feedback from stakeholders across the organization, which helped to improve the quality of the designs and ensure that they were aligned with the company's overall goals. Additionally, the demos served as a way to showcase the progress that was being made on the product roadmap, which helped to build excitement and momentum among team members.

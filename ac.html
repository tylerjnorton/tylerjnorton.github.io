                    </p>
                    <p><b>My Role</b> ― Co-founder & CCO - Build a team and execute on all things product and creative.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Challenge</b> ― Creating product, brand, and marketing strategy. Focus heavily on user
                        experience design, user interface design,
                        and design systems while also having a mind towards development cycles.</p>

                        is

                    <h3>The Brand ―</h3>
                    <p>When I was first contacted by Athleticalendar there were no creatives or designers on board. It
                        was a single sales
                        person outsourcing his development and design to a small company in India.
                    </p>
                    <p>The first step was developing a unifying and identifiable brand identity for Athleticalendar. Using strongly contrasting colors
                        and bold (in stature, not weight) font choices, we rebranded to what you see today. One of the key components of the new logo was the 
                        ability to create a logo and an icon that would be instantly recognizable together for when we begin to pivot to our mobile app experience.
                        This also enabled us to be more versatile for our providers with how they choose to advertise their listings on their material both digital and print.
                    </p>
                    <p><br /></p>
                    <h3>External Use Guides ―</h3>
                    <p>With so many providers pointing their users to our platform (and their listing), external use of our brand was important for us to regulate.
                        We now provide our users with everything they need to create their own advertising using our brand and theirs together. If a company does not
                        have the resources to create their own marketing, we even provide printable flyers per listing which are automated and put together with the data 
                        they provide when creating their listing. We also offer pre-made marketing images for our providers to quickly and easily add to their current site.

                    <h3>User Experience ―</h3>
                    <p>After bringing the company over to sharetribe (a CMS platform for two way marketplaces) and
                        stripe (for payments), the focus
                        turned to perfecting user stories and flows. A two sided marketplace is sometimes tough to find
                        the balance between ease of use
                        for providers and for customers, but by simplifying the flows for both parties we were able to
                        get to a point where both ends of the user spectrum were seeing success with our platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>We face many specific UX challenges when it comes to a two sided marketplace. Read more about how we 
                        develop, design, and overcome them on our development blog at <a href="http://www.medium.com/athleticalendar">medium.com/athleticalendar</a>.

                    <h3>Agile Development Process ―</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our process for planning development milestones and sprints is planned and executed using github. We are a small team but 
                        we are constantly pushing out features and planning the next ones. Using this process and these tools allows us to stay on top of what is being worked on, what is next 
                        and keep a transparent workflow for everyone involved to know realistic timelines and expectations for the work that is being completed.
                        As the head of product, I am responsible for planning the sprints and milestones as well as leading scrums. It is a small team, I wear many hats.

                    <h3>Results ―</h3>
                    <p>Our SaaS platform is a great example of what a single shared vision from co-founders can produce with the right people in place.
                        In an extremely short time we have gone from 0 to 1 and beyond. Our product continues to evolve and add users, listings, and features all the time.

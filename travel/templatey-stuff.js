I can tell you that this was the first time I ever left the country. I was 18 years old and a freshman at Champlain college. Traveling with a big group of friends from high school, college, and the locals we made friends with, we went and saw Big D and the Kids Table along with Reggie and the Full Effect on a Saturday night.</p><p>Among the things I remember are the bassist from Big D inviting a guy on stage to kick his ass, Matty B having about 5 liquid cocaine shots at the Cock and Bull, Matty B throwing up all over the side of his car the next day at the border, and finally the border patrol dog licking it off the side of his car while the agent shook his head. They let us back through and were probably pretty happy to be ridding Canada of my friends and I. For now.</p><p>This was also the first time I made firends abroad! Pearse, Sly, Zorro, and Matty B were the concert crew and we met a few locals Sonya and Meaghan who took us out for poutine after and showed us the good spots. Good times!</p>",

This month(s) or so I spent on Andy Hunter's couch. Good ol' 3 Windemeres. I know that address by heart because I should have known it heading into customs. This was before cell hpones worked abroad easily and smartphones were hardly a thing. So when I was stopped at customs and asked for an address, I told the truth. I didn't know. My friends were about to pick me up, what did I care? Well, they cared. I ended up making up an address an hour later and getting through on my second attempt. Oops.</p><p>From there it was basketball and soccer at broadway. Crazy golf and cricket nonsense in the octopus, and the beginning of a life long love affair with Post Place and pukka pies.</p><p>Soon the griend group ballooned to include Nath, Tracy, MarcO, and more. As you'll see in this journey, I will return many times to Evesham and meet the firends I made there all around the world for holidays both domestic and abroad.</p><p>Oh, and they consider TGI Friday's to be American food. It is like they learned nothing from the Virginia fast food tour we took when they were over for the wedding.</p><p>I also spent a weekend working at Prescott Hill Climb. Fliping burgers, slinging brews, and hanging out with super rich guys with nice cars. Nothing like a 48 hour shift while sleeping in the booths at night to come up with a couple grand to work my way around Europe.</p>",

A little place (that no longer exists) that me and a few friends flipped from bar to coffee shop. The help exchange works like this: I live in a place for free, they get a few hours of work per day out of me. Don't ask don't tell with regards to the visas and such. Works for me!</p><p>I stayed with the owner of this cafe Gaja in her place in town. Clearing out the bar by day and drinking at the local pub with local music by night, I made friends with Jaric, Darren, and Mijke quickly and had some companions to wander around the region with while we weren't moving furniture or creating flyers and brochures for the cafe. As you can see in the photos, we even uncovered and fixed up a pool table with snooker balls in the back area as a little break place for us to hang out. It was such a beautiful place and a slowed down way of life that looking back, I was not ready for yet. But I would absolutely love if it were my life today.<p>This was also my first time completely alone in a new country. It helped that the first day I was there the old guy at the bar recognized my Emmanuel Baseball jacket and asked if I went there. I told him I had and he revealed that he grew up about 2 minutes from there in Brookline. Small world. And something that made me feel much more comfort in the fact that almost no matter where you go in the world, you'll find someone that you have something in common with if you try and talk to strangers and make friends.</p><p>One of the only things I really remember specifically about these few days is driving around with Jarek listening to a sampler CD he had that had Young Folks on it by Peter, Bjorn, and John well before it made it big in the states. This song will always remind me of Ireland.</p>",

Their little girl kept pointing at me. Nonstop pointing. She was probably only 4 at the time, but she even walked over and pointed again. Right at my hat. As her dad pulled her back to the table he said 'I know! Its the Red Sox' in the thickest Boston accent. They were from Brockton and lived over there now and she hadn't seen a sox logo anywhere but on tv and at home and got excited.</p><p>Its a silly little non-story, but I'll always remember that.</p>",

A fellow American on tour, we hit it off and hung out all over the continent for a while. The first few days we stayed at Tiber Village. A small campground/hostel-ish thing a bit out of the city. It was a huge pain in the butt but very cheap. The second time we stayed at a hostel near the city center called The Yellow. That was a far better experience and location.</p><p>We did all of the usual tourist stuff, the forum, colosseum, Vatican, pantheon, etc. But one of the funnier stories was when we were walking in one of the many piazzas for lunch one day we heard a person playing guitar. They were playing the song Kids by MGMT. So we knew the song, stuck around and listened until he was finished. Then to our amazement, he handed the guitar back to the street performer and went and sat to eat lunch at a table! We walked up to him and asked what that was about and he told us that they are on vacation as well and he tells people he is in MGMT and asks to play a song for fun. The guys were hilarious and awesome and it was a really good rendition of Kids too.</p><p>Rome, like all of Italy, is a great time with some incredible food. Rome is very touristy though. For the English speaking only crowd it is great, but for the people who want a real Italian experience I would recommend somewhere other than Rome.</p>",

I'd also recommend going across the river to The Boboli Gardens, a big maze of vegetation on a steep hill. When you get to the top you get an awesome view of Florence and the Tuscan countryside.</p><p>Climbing to the top of the Duomo is another definite to do. The views are spectacular from the catwalk at the top and it is the highest point in Florence. Lastly, find yourself some gelato. It is delicious. The further off the beaten path the better.</p>",

Even a map won't help most times since GPS isn't quite precise enough on the island. Pick landmarks and work your way around. I would highly recommend taking as many wrong turns as you possible and getting lost on the most beautiful little streets you can.</p><p>Find a small place to eat, not a populated area. I still remember my first taste of speck (an Italian meat that is adjacent to prosciutto). It was at a tiny little place where no one spoke English, Pane Vino e San Daniele Rialto. Our lovely server came over and broken Italian/English-ed her way through the menu. It was an outstanding experience and the best food.</p><p>There are however a few “American” places too. I really needed a taste of home one day while I was there.

We planned to go to Switzerland for another helpx, but scheduling was mixed up and we found ourselves with one more night in Venice and no destination or place to stay in 24 hours. I still remember looking at her and saying that this wasn't sad, it was awesome. We have 6 days to spend anywhere we want! So where do you want to go? 30 minutes later we had flights and hotels booked for Paris in the morning.</p><p>That being said, when you book Ryanair, you should check when and where the flight goes. This “Paris” airport was about 90 minutes north of Paris, and since the flight arrived at about 11pm local time we were left waiting a bit for a shuttle to the city center. We also found two Canadian girls who were just out of high school and who arrived with no real plan. They were going to sleep in the airport, so we invited them with us and told them that we had a hotel room that was pretty cheap. If they couldn't book their own room there they could at least sleep on the floor of ours so they were safe.</p><p>When we arrived around 12:45am, the metro was no longer running. So the four of us piled into a taxi and set off for the hotel. Rachel was from rural Oklahoma and had never taken a taxi before and assumed they were all over $100. I think they total came to about $6 each when we split it 4 ways.</p><p>As cliche as it may seem, the best part of Paris is the lawn in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower. There are always people picnicking, playing, and just generally being happy. It is a wonderful place to spend the afternoon as long as you can resist the opportunity to buy keychains and homemade bracelets from borderline homeless people.</p><p>Another favorite of mine was the Centre Pompidou. I love modern art and this place was the best I've ever been. The building itself is a masterpiece. I would highly recommend visiting even if you aren't interested because of the walk through installations they have. It is truly a great experience.</p><p>We stayed at Mary's Hotel in the 11th arr. It was nothing spectacular, but they let me sit in the lobby and use the wifi to watch the Celtics playoff game at 3am so they are a-ok in my book. If you need a budget place, I'd recommend it. It was really convenient to the metro as well and had a nice market out in front of it on the weekend.</p><p>I wrote on facebook about staying up and watching the Celtics and one of my friends replied that they would be in Paris tomorrow, so we spent the day sightseeing. Me, Rachel, Cris, and Lindsey. It was great to have a taste of back home after a few months on the road.</p>",

Madrid 1–0 LFC. The stadium was incredible and the home supporters were rowdy. This was truly one of my football bucket list experiences. The Spanish supporters were quite friendly (I'm sure it helped that Liverpool were no real threat to them, but still) to us through our entire night there. The post match party was at an Irish Pub called Dubliners that was full of happy English people.</p><p>If I'm honest, this was mostly a football vacation with a dusting of culture sprinkled in. Most of that culture consisted of eating and drinking (a lot). We got a little culture in Toledo after our Madrid days, but if in Madrid and looking to go have a good time, hit the bars on Calle Cava de San Miguel. I will also say that not speaking a lick of Spanish is a bit of an obstacle even though Madrid is a massive city. If you aren't in a specifically English speaking part (read: touristy), then you're likely going to have to go Spanish for your interactions. Still, great culture, great city, great fun.</p>",

Instead we spent our day taking the Toledo Train Tour (note: not really a train). That took us through a lot of the historic spots in the city as well as across the river protecting the city to see it in its entirety. The tour took about 90 minutes and we felt like we had covered most of what was in Toledo.</p><p>That night we walked around the neatly lit small streets around our airbnb and had a nice meal and a few drinks.

      "<p>We arrived in Edinburgh after a 4 hour drive on a Monday morning from Liverpool. The drive was pretty beautiful and relatively flat but the views were great. The small villages that you drive through on the A7 are pretty neat. Every little town you go through will have at least a spot for tea if not a full on pub. There were a lot of little bed and breakfasts around as well and if you're not into city life it would be a great spot to stay that is accessible to everything but still full of beautiful countryside scenery.</p><p>We stayed in a wonderful Airbnb and would highly recommend this neighborhood. It was the perfect location for walking and hitting all of the different neighborhoods and most of the big attractions are no more than a 30-45 minute walk away, with many being much closer than that.</p><p>Some of the cliche tourist spots are still pretty incredible. Places like Arthur's Seat are a must see, even if it may be a little crowded at the top. The views across the entire city are well worth the trek and the company. You'll want to do this on the most clear day you can because the views are really the main attraction. Prepare yourself for extreme winds (60+mph) when you are at some points towards the top as well, I thought it was fun, but I could see it being dangerous for someone smaller. The hike is very short and very easy, but the views are wonderful. I won't ruin it for you, but here is a taste of the way up.</p><p>The Royal Mile and Edinburgh Castle are the two other main tourist attractions in Edinburgh. These two will be packed with people all the time, but are still a neat look into the history of the city. The castle is filled with walk in museums that tell the history of the castle and Scotland's military. If you are looking for more history about the city itself (and not the military), I would recommend the Mercat Historic Underground Tour (£13 for adults). No need for a sunny day on that one either because a lot of the tour is underground in the cities historic vaults. The tour guides are very knowledgable and tell some fascinating stories.</p><p>The food in Edinburgh was better than expected. I will admit, I am a meat and potatoes kind of guy, but there was plenty of food from all over the world for anyone to find something that fits their taste. As an avid sports fan, I was keen on finding a spot with the big matches on as well as some good food and good atmosphere. Lucky for us we found The Golf Tavern a 5 minute walk from where we stayed. We ate and drank there on the first night and the last night of our trip. The traditional Scottish “Haggis, Tatties, and Mashed Neeps” were excellent.</p><p>There are more options that just the local cuisine in Edinburgh though. We found some amazing Korean, Italian, Wine Bars, and Whiskey bars as well. The Hanging Bat was probably our best food spot of the city. The mix of southern USA BBQ and craft beer was right up our alley. Their very helpful and knowledgable staff was more than welcoming and helped us in finding some interesting drinks too. I would highly, highly recommend the BBQ chicken wings. They were quite possibly the best I've had outside of the actual Southern United States.</p>",

      "<p>Our one day drive took us 2-3 hours each way (with photo pit stops) from Edinburgh to Inveraray Castle. Inveraray Castle is the home of the Campbell Clan of Scotland. It is open seasonally, so be careful not to go during the winter or early spring. Loch Lomond and the surrounding areas are open all the time and have many different tourist attractions in the area.</p><p>Our main goal was to get the castle. We took the less direct route to get there so we could avoid the motorways and take the more scenic A and B roads. I would recommend this, but past a certain point, you will be taking A roads anyway and the views are really in the mandatory part of the drive anyway. So you won't be missing much if you just follow the navigation's shortest route.</p><p>While the castle is beautiful, the real attraction is the drive. The roads wind through, up, down, and around the mountains of the national park and the views are incredible. I would recommend pulling over and talking short walks off the roads if you spot something in the distance. We found some of the best views and hidden things like the waterfall pictured above as well as some wildlife just off the beaten path. Bring your hiking boots though, the ground is often wet and squishy. A change of socks and potentially shoes too is needed if you stray too far.</p><p>The town Inveraray is small with a few cafes, pubs, and bed and breakfasts to go with a small residential area and the castle itself. The location right on the water of one of the many lochs in that region makes for outstanding views of water, mountains, and forests.</p><p>I mentioned in the opening paragraph that the castle is seasonal. We found that out the hard way even though it is not listed as such on the website. Luckily, we could still walk all around the castle and explore the area. We got a few good photos, but unfortunately could not go inside.</p><p>If you go get to the castle when it is closed, be sure to keep walking all the way around the castle. There are closed gates, but you can walk around and get up close to the castle if you keep walking. There are also nice views of a few bridges and a nice walk around the castle grounds.</p>",

The Wee Puffin is a small little cafe/restaurant in Grantown-on-Spey. The food was outstanding, the interior is filled with little puffin paintings and drawings that are (for the most part) for sale, and the owner was extremely friendly and helpful and even gave us a tip on a hidden scenic point on the way back.

We ended up getting scammed by a second market site. While they gave our money back, they double sold our tickets and we found out the night before the match. Not ideal.</p><p>Anyway, there were five of us (two Americans and three English) that stayed from a Saturday to Thursday at an airbnb just behind Alameda de Hercules. That was a perfect spot for us. Between us and the river there was basically an endless array of tapas bars, shops, and Spanish culture. As with any Spanish city the game plan for tourists/sightseeing has to be “sleep in, sight see, early afternoon lunch, siesta, late dinner”. Everything basically shuts down between 3:30pm and 7:30pm at the least. Get used to napping and staying out late!</p><p>One of our favorite spots that we continually went back to was (as far as we could tell) the only bar serving Sidra (Spanish Cider) in Seville. La alacena de san eloy was such a home spot for us that on our final night we were walking up the street towards it and the owner/bartender spotted us, held his hand in the air (5) and brought us out cinco sidra with a smile. They were very kind to us there and I would without question suggest anyone heading there to go have a sip or two of Sidre. At 1 Euro each, it really can't be beat.</p><p>We ate some pretty great food while we were there as well, but the one that stood out the most was Mesón el Serranito. It took us a day or two to find this little area of tapas places but this was the best area for food we found by far. The food was incredible and as with most of the places in Seville, you sit outside and enjoy the beautiful weather.</p><p>Overall, Seville is just a really beautiful city. I would recommend NOT renting a car. Parking it is both near impossible and very expensive. Try to avoid it if at all feasible. Walk everywhere and try out as much of the local cuisine as you can. I'd also recommend knowing a little Spanish. While some places have English speakers or even menus, the authentic spots are all in Spanish. Seville has everything from craft beer places, to sports pubs, to tapas bars, to upscale dining and cocktail spots. It was an outstanding and fun 4 days and nights for us.</p>",

We stayed at an airbnb in Bairro Alto, a lively neighborhood with loads of nightlife. It was thanksgiving day for us (Americans) when we arrived so we headed out in the rain to have what was possibly the most adventurous meal I've had so far.</p><p>We ended up at Restaurante Vicente. This place had tapas, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese food. The last item on their menu however, was “the chef's voyage”. You don't know what you get, but when it comes out it is 7 rounds of tapas of the chef's choice. I ended up taking the voyage for my Thanksgiving abroad and had Iberian ham, ox tail croquettes, seared tuna, fois grois, octopus, and a ham, potatoes, and egg mix to finish it off…. and an ice cream-ish dessert. Cris got the risotto which was also incredible, while less adventurous.</p><p>That however was only the beginning. Portugal has amazing food and for a few other great meals head to Moules and Beer for some muscles or to Restaurante Arte de Mercado for an amazing traditional Portuguese sandwich (pictured below).</p><p>Another one of my favorite things to explore in the cities I visit (when I have time) are modern art museums. I would highly recommend checking out Berardo Collection Museum in Lisbon. When I was there they had some great things to show, and admission is only 5 Euro. Well worth it if you ask me. The surrounding area also has a ton of things to see from a maritime museum to a natural history museum. Whatever type of art you are into, I am sure there is a place for you in that area. I'd also suggest a walk along the water back towards the city center to find some great (and odd) architecture and some good oceanside spots for a bite and a beer.</p>",

Monaco proper is quite expensive, but also beautiful and every bit worth visiting. Our first night after we checked in to our airbnb, we walked down a few stairs (an ongoing theme of the weekend) to an amazing Italian place called il-terrazzino. On a weekend full of amazing food, it was the best meal we had there. The MENU NAPOLETANO is a medley of all the best food on the menu; pasta, fish, meat, bread, desserts, cheese. It was amazing.</p><p>One of my friends who lives in the area suggested we take a short drive into France to Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat. This little mostly residential peninsula was beautiful and not crowded at all in spite of the outstanding weather. I ended up even taking a dip in the Mediterranean to cool off after lunch and a lot of walking. Public beaches, cute shops, and a few good spots for food made this place an enjoyable afternoon before our night out in Monaco.</p><p>Like most casino experiences, the dealers make the nights. While the Monte Carlo casino itself was stunning to see, it really was not our speed with the high stakes and uptight atmosphere around the tables of the high rollers (which sadly, we are not). So after checking Monte Carlo off with a few wagers and a beer, we headed around town to one of the other casinos “Sun” to play Craps (which is somehow not offered at Monte Carlo). There, we found another outstanding meal at the attached restaurant and a banter filled dealer to watch us lose our money shooting craps all night.</p><p>The last day there we took a drive in the other direction across two borders to Italy for a relaxing seaside lunch with pizza from Costa Azzurra. Our weekend of outstanding food continued (shocking, I know) with an affordable giant specialty pizza. After a walk down the borderline deserted beach we stopped into a little pub that had Sky Sports to watch a bit of the football and then we were on our way. An excellent, though expensive, weekend.</p>",

      "<p>Returning to Paris was much more fun the second time around. I was much more seasoned of a traveler by now and staying in much better places. This time I was met by Fraz and MarcO from the UK as well as Phil from home. We spent our day or two in Paris (part of the Paris/Amsterdam/Rotterdam trip before coming home for the holidays) seeing the major sights and spending time eating giant crepes. Both savory and sweet for Fraz please and thank you.</p><p>As always, the highlight of the trip was Centre Pompediu. For my money, the best museum in the world. I'm a bit biased towards modern art, but still. So many interesting things to see and even the building itself is facinating. If you are ever going to Paris, you have to give it a visit.</p>",

We spent most of the time trying to make the employees break character (a few times successfully) which served to break the tension for a few in our tour group who clearly spoke very little english but were absolutely horrified by the jump scares.</p><p>I will not ruin the end of the show for everyone but lets say it all culminated in a very dark room with my mate Fraz jumping a mile high when he found himself the target of one of the scares. Great times all around. Had to shake that one off a bit after with a visit to the body works exhibit (significantly less frightening).</p><p>Overall a great city filled with great people, especially if you can manage to find some places away from the thousands of tourists that descend on it daily.</p>",

There was a lot to do in general because I was there for 4 months. I won't cover it all here obviously (4 months is a long time) but it was great to live with Fraz and see the lads on the regular for a while.</p>",

Here are a few spots which were worth visiting if you're interested in that sort of thing: Marienplatz, Hofbräuhaus, sNed Kelly's Australian Bar (for the footy), Augustiner Klosterwirt, and Hans Im Gluk. But the best place we went was the first night (pictured above and below) called Nuernberger Bratwurst Gloeckl am Dom. My God was it incredible, like German Thanksgiving.</p><p>Another great spot was brunch on matchday at Mr. Pancake with one of the friendliest waitresses ever in Martina. We actually became friends and hung out the next day. Well, Hunter remained passed out, but we took a lovely Munich tour.</p>",

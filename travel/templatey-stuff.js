I can tell you that this was the first time I ever left the country. I was 18 years old and a freshman at Champlain college. Traveling with a big group of friends from high school, college, and the locals we made friends with, we went and saw Big D and the Kids Table along with Reggie and the Full Effect on a Saturday night.</p><p>Among the things I remember are the bassist from Big D inviting a guy on stage to kick his ass, Matty B having about 5 liquid cocaine shots at the Cock and Bull, Matty B throwing up all over the side of his car the next day at the border, and finally the border patrol dog licking it off the side of his car while the agent shook his head. They let us back through and were probably pretty happy to be ridding Canada of my friends and I. For now.</p><p>This was also the first time I made firends abroad! Pearse, Sly, Zorro, and Matty B were the concert crew and we met a few locals Sonya and Meaghan who took us out for poutine after and showed us the good spots. Good times!</p>",

This month(s) or so I spent on Andy Hunter's couch. Good ol' 3 Windemeres. I know that address by heart because I should have known it heading into customs. This was before cell hpones worked abroad easily and smartphones were hardly a thing. So when I was stopped at customs and asked for an address, I told the truth. I didn't know. My friends were about to pick me up, what did I care? Well, they cared. I ended up making up an address an hour later and getting through on my second attempt. Oops.</p><p>From there it was basketball and soccer at broadway. Crazy golf and cricket nonsense in the octopus, and the beginning of a life long love affair with Post Place and pukka pies.</p><p>Soon the griend group ballooned to include Nath, Tracy, MarcO, and more. As you'll see in this journey, I will return many times to Evesham and meet the firends I made there all around the world for holidays both domestic and abroad.</p><p>Oh, and they consider TGI Friday's to be American food. It is like they learned nothing from the Virginia fast food tour we took when they were over for the wedding.</p><p>I also spent a weekend working at Prescott Hill Climb. Fliping burgers, slinging brews, and hanging out with super rich guys with nice cars. Nothing like a 48 hour shift while sleeping in the booths at night to come up with a couple grand to work my way around Europe.</p>",

A little place (that no longer exists) that me and a few friends flipped from bar to coffee shop. The help exchange works like this: I live in a place for free, they get a few hours of work per day out of me. Don't ask don't tell with regards to the visas and such. Works for me!</p><p>I stayed with the owner of this cafe Gaja in her place in town. Clearing out the bar by day and drinking at the local pub with local music by night, I made friends with Jaric, Darren, and Mijke quickly and had some companions to wander around the region with while we weren't moving furniture or creating flyers and brochures for the cafe. As you can see in the photos, we even uncovered and fixed up a pool table with snooker balls in the back area as a little break place for us to hang out. It was such a beautiful place and a slowed down way of life that looking back, I was not ready for yet. But I would absolutely love if it were my life today.<p>This was also my first time completely alone in a new country. It helped that the first day I was there the old guy at the bar recognized my Emmanuel Baseball jacket and asked if I went there. I told him I had and he revealed that he grew up about 2 minutes from there in Brookline. Small world. And something that made me feel much more comfort in the fact that almost no matter where you go in the world, you'll find someone that you have something in common with if you try and talk to strangers and make friends.</p><p>One of the only things I really remember specifically about these few days is driving around with Jarek listening to a sampler CD he had that had Young Folks on it by Peter, Bjorn, and John well before it made it big in the states. This song will always remind me of Ireland.</p>",

Their little girl kept pointing at me. Nonstop pointing. She was probably only 4 at the time, but she even walked over and pointed again. Right at my hat. As her dad pulled her back to the table he said 'I know! Its the Red Sox' in the thickest Boston accent. They were from Brockton and lived over there now and she hadn't seen a sox logo anywhere but on tv and at home and got excited.</p><p>Its a silly little non-story, but I'll always remember that.</p>",

A fellow American on tour, we hit it off and hung out all over the continent for a while. The first few days we stayed at Tiber Village. A small campground/hostel-ish thing a bit out of the city. It was a huge pain in the butt but very cheap. The second time we stayed at a hostel near the city center called The Yellow. That was a far better experience and location.</p><p>We did all of the usual tourist stuff, the forum, colosseum, Vatican, pantheon, etc. But one of the funnier stories was when we were walking in one of the many piazzas for lunch one day we heard a person playing guitar. They were playing the song Kids by MGMT. So we knew the song, stuck around and listened until he was finished. Then to our amazement, he handed the guitar back to the street performer and went and sat to eat lunch at a table! We walked up to him and asked what that was about and he told us that they are on vacation as well and he tells people he is in MGMT and asks to play a song for fun. The guys were hilarious and awesome and it was a really good rendition of Kids too.</p><p>Rome, like all of Italy, is a great time with some incredible food. Rome is very touristy though. For the English speaking only crowd it is great, but for the people who want a real Italian experience I would recommend somewhere other than Rome.</p>",

I'd also recommend going across the river to The Boboli Gardens, a big maze of vegetation on a steep hill. When you get to the top you get an awesome view of Florence and the Tuscan countryside.</p><p>Climbing to the top of the Duomo is another definite to do. The views are spectacular from the catwalk at the top and it is the highest point in Florence. Lastly, find yourself some gelato. It is delicious. The further off the beaten path the better.</p>",

Even a map won't help most times since GPS isn't quite precise enough on the island. Pick landmarks and work your way around. I would highly recommend taking as many wrong turns as you possible and getting lost on the most beautiful little streets you can.</p><p>Find a small place to eat, not a populated area. I still remember my first taste of speck (an Italian meat that is adjacent to prosciutto). It was at a tiny little place where no one spoke English, Pane Vino e San Daniele Rialto. Our lovely server came over and broken Italian/English-ed her way through the menu. It was an outstanding experience and the best food.</p><p>There are however a few “American” places too. I really needed a taste of home one day while I was there.

We planned to go to Switzerland for another helpx, but scheduling was mixed up and we found ourselves with one more night in Venice and no destination or place to stay in 24 hours. I still remember looking at her and saying that this wasn't sad, it was awesome. We have 6 days to spend anywhere we want! So where do you want to go? 30 minutes later we had flights and hotels booked for Paris in the morning.</p><p>That being said, when you book Ryanair, you should check when and where the flight goes. This “Paris” airport was about 90 minutes north of Paris, and since the flight arrived at about 11pm local time we were left waiting a bit for a shuttle to the city center. We also found two Canadian girls who were just out of high school and who arrived with no real plan. They were going to sleep in the airport, so we invited them with us and told them that we had a hotel room that was pretty cheap. If they couldn't book their own room there they could at least sleep on the floor of ours so they were safe.</p><p>When we arrived around 12:45am, the metro was no longer running. So the four of us piled into a taxi and set off for the hotel. Rachel was from rural Oklahoma and had never taken a taxi before and assumed they were all over $100. I think they total came to about $6 each when we split it 4 ways.</p><p>As cliche as it may seem, the best part of Paris is the lawn in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower. There are always people picnicking, playing, and just generally being happy. It is a wonderful place to spend the afternoon as long as you can resist the opportunity to buy keychains and homemade bracelets from borderline homeless people.</p><p>Another favorite of mine was the Centre Pompidou. I love modern art and this place was the best I've ever been. The building itself is a masterpiece. I would highly recommend visiting even if you aren't interested because of the walk through installations they have. It is truly a great experience.</p><p>We stayed at Mary's Hotel in the 11th arr. It was nothing spectacular, but they let me sit in the lobby and use the wifi to watch the Celtics playoff game at 3am so they are a-ok in my book. If you need a budget place, I'd recommend it. It was really convenient to the metro as well and had a nice market out in front of it on the weekend.</p><p>I wrote on facebook about staying up and watching the Celtics and one of my friends replied that they would be in Paris tomorrow, so we spent the day sightseeing. Me, Rachel, Cris, and Lindsey. It was great to have a taste of back home after a few months on the road.</p>",

Madrid 1–0 LFC. The stadium was incredible and the home supporters were rowdy. This was truly one of my football bucket list experiences. The Spanish supporters were quite friendly (I'm sure it helped that Liverpool were no real threat to them, but still) to us through our entire night there. The post match party was at an Irish Pub called Dubliners that was full of happy English people.</p><p>If I'm honest, this was mostly a football vacation with a dusting of culture sprinkled in. Most of that culture consisted of eating and drinking (a lot). We got a little culture in Toledo after our Madrid days, but if in Madrid and looking to go have a good time, hit the bars on Calle Cava de San Miguel. I will also say that not speaking a lick of Spanish is a bit of an obstacle even though Madrid is a massive city. If you aren't in a specifically English speaking part (read: touristy), then you're likely going to have to go Spanish for your interactions. Still, great culture, great city, great fun.</p>",

Instead we spent our day taking the Toledo Train Tour (note: not really a train). That took us through a lot of the historic spots in the city as well as across the river protecting the city to see it in its entirety. The tour took about 90 minutes and we felt like we had covered most of what was in Toledo.</p><p>That night we walked around the neatly lit small streets around our airbnb and had a nice meal and a few drinks.

      "<p>The Shelvy Game was my first ever trip to Anfield. Sitting in the Anfield Road end we watched Henderson score a brace, Shelvey assist one on both ends, and score a banger, and ultimately Liverpool coming out on top of Swansea City 4-3. It was a great match but only the second best 4-3 I've seen at Anfield to date. More on that next time.</p><p>It wouldn't be the last, but that second half winner from Henderson at the kop end was a sight to behold. I had to come back, and soon.</p>",

We rented a great airbnb together, a few SUVs, threw our clubs in the back and hit the links. We played rounds at Louge Erne’s Faldo Course, Donegal Golf Club, Enniscrone, Co. Sligo Golf Club, and Bundoran.</p><p>On our non golf days we hung out in the tiny town we were staying in called Pettigo. Pettigo is right on the border of Ireland and Northern Ireland, so much so that our airbnb host’s property was a bit in each. We also loved the local hotel/pub The Pettigo Inn. The cheesy garlic bread and the toasties were the favorites, as well as enjoying a few pints while listening to a live music duo play. They even snuck in a little Sweet Caroline for the gang from New England.</p>",

Its too commercial and touristy but there was so much to do outside of just the falls that it gets the edge over the American side for me. Plus the view is much better of the falls itself! Definitely worth waiting in line on the bridge to see.</p>",

While it isn’t mainland Europe, it is its own unique adventure island. I would highly recommend spending 4–5 days exploring. Sao Miguel is the main island of the Azores and it is filled with hikes, small towns, hot springs, and adventures. Some specific highlights were Furnas, Ribery Grande, and Sete Cidades.</p><p>There is a ton to be done with hiking trails all around the island and long winding adventrous roads that wind up and down volcanoes, along the coast, and in and out of literal jungles. The whole island is spectacular. There are hot springs in the ocean as well as most of the way up the mountain at Furnas that is from the volcano. If you can put asside the sulfur smell then it is a great and relaxing time. We were there in January, so it was almost empty but still quite nice with temps in the 60s and 70s the whole time.</p>",

All highly recommended but also well covered by other travel publications. I&rsquo;d rather talk about the all chicken themed place we stopped for dinner and drinks called Scharrels en Schuim. A narrow bar/restaurant with full wall windows, a great menu of both beer and chicken, and an upstairs with live music a few nights a week (usually jazz).</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t all late night eats though, we got up for some waffles (pictured above) from a shockingly good vegan place called Backyard.

      "<p>At the end of 2018&rsquo;s travels, a few English friends and I stayed in Rotterdam for a week&rsquo;s vacation before I headed back to the states. We stayed at Weena, right next to the train station and really close to everything else the city has to offer.</p><p>Our first night was a few quiet drinks at Bierlokaal Locus Publicus. It is an awesome little brewhouse with great beers from the area as well as some traditional local snacks to keep you going through the night. Perfect atmosphere inside as well for dimly lit intimate surroundings. Everyone speaks English so well that one of my friends asked &ldquo;where are you from&rdquo; expecting a city in England and the response was &ldquo;from here&rdquo;.</p><p>We hit all the normal touristy things and ate at the Markthal downtown, saw the cube homes, and took a trip up the Euromast. All highly recommended but also well covered by other travel publications. I&rsquo;d rather talk about the all chicken themed place we stopped for dinner and drinks called Scharrels en Schuim. A narrow bar/restaurant with full wall windows, a great menu of both beer and chicken, and an upstairs with live music a few nights a week (usually jazz).</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t all late night eats though, we got up for some waffles (pictured above) from a shockingly good vegan place called Backyard. It was probably the best waffle I&rsquo;ve ever had, not that I&rsquo;m an expert. We also took the tram to the other side of the river for a tour of Stadion Feyenoord. Sadly, Dirk Kuyt was not there. Pair that with a few 30 minute train rides for the big days and nights in Amsterdam and you&rsquo;ve got quite the nice time in the Netherlands.</p>",

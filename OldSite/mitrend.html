                    <h3>The Brand ―</h3>
                    <p>When I arrived at Mitrend there were no creatives. No designers. No UX experts. It was a group of
                        developers and programmers who were using a single form to allow
                        users to upload log files that they have pulled off of their hardware via terminal script or
                        hardware specific process. Then our backend would do magic and email a
                        powerpoint report full of tables and spreadsheets in the default powerpoint
                        style.
                    </p>
                    <p>Step one for me was to give Mitrend a brand and identity so we could begin to make headway as a
                        brand and company. While the company uses an agile process for development
                        cycles, the newly formed (and growing) creative team was allowed time to research our
                        competitors, brainstorm, and refine our logo, typography, and colors. After decisions were
                        made with regards to brand and identity, we began to build out a branding style guide with an
                        eye towards our next project, the platform.

                    <h3>User Experience ―</h3>
                    <p>One of the major issues with the user experience was that there was no platform. They uploaded a
                        file and attached an email address to send the results to. No viewing old
                        reports, no way to resend it without contacting support, no way to log in and adjust
                        preferences, settings, or manage data. The first major rework of the user experience
                        was adding a logged in section, historical upload data, and an ability to export and interact
                        with reports online.
                    </p>
                    <p>Pictured above is one of our wireframes and user flows for our online platform. When we gave
                        users the ability to log in and explore their data, we also had to add other pages
                        that allowed them to download our data gathering tool, view and export their old reports, and
                        upload new data with varying levels of features and support depending on the type
                        of account.

                    <p><br /></p>
                    <h3>Style Guides ―</h3>
                    <p>While creating the web portal and the software for collecting data, we made sure that our branding
                        principles were followed to create a unified and seamless flow between apps, platforms, and
                        reports.
                        Keeping a uniform look across products is paramount to keeping a clean and recognizable
                        brand.
                    </p>

                    <h3>UI Design ―</h3>
                    <p>In addition to creating the user stories and flows through our products, my team was responsible
                        for designing all the UI elements that were used across our products. While
                        many of them can be easily pulled from the style guide when the developers need them, there were
                        also custom elements for a few solutions that we created and support the
                        developers during their agile sprints to ensure they implemented them correctly.

                    <h3>Software ―</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our data collection software was a downloadable file to run against your storage or backup
                        arrays that would allow users to automatically upload your results to our platform
                        or to get a simple report without having any contact with our online system. It walked you
                        through scans of many different types of systems and had the potential to merge
                        data from a few different sources as well.

                    <h3>Infographics & Reports ―</h3>
                    <p>When I joined Mitrend we were giving out powerpoints with default style as a report. Some of our
                        customers would screenshot it and put it into their own deck to present
                        to others, so when we updated to our own style, we wanted to keep it relatively neutral so that
                        regardless of our customers' brand, our content would not seem out of place.
                        We offered our infographics in both pdf and slide format, both available as a download from our
                        web platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our web platform also offered extra exploratory tools for our users to pivot data around in
                        custom tables and charts as well as providing sizing, cost, and efficiency projections
                        for potential solutions to any problems that our data analysis discovered.

                    <h3>Results ―</h3>
                    <p>Our SaaS platform included a file scanning desktop application, a web portal to
                        organize and interact with the data gathered,
                        interactive reports, branded powerpoints, and other custom reporting material for
                        our users.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our SaaS platform has over 10k+ users including multiple fortune 50 companies and
                        drove
                        $5b+ in revenue for our users.
